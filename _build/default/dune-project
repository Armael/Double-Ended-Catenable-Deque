  (description
    "\
A double-ended queue is an ordered collection for which elements can be \
added and removed from the front and the back. This library provides a \
purely functional implementation, such that the following operations are \
all worst-case constant time:
- `push` adds an element to the front of the deque
- `pop` pops the left-most element
- `inject` adds an element at the back
- `eject` pops the right-most element
- `concat` concatenates two deques
This datastructure was invented by Kaplan and Tarjan.
The OCaml code presented was written by Arthur Wendling at \
https://github.com/art-w/deque/tree/master")
